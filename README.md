This repo is for our paper titled "A Tutorial for Developing Customizable Online Systems for Conducting Operant Experiments".

The "Front end" folder includes source codes written in JavaScript and CSS in the HTML format whereas the "Back end" folder includes source codes written in PHP. You should upload the former source codes to your WordPress dashboard and the latter ones to your server. For details, check "Instructions for GitHub users.txt" in each of the folders.

You have to replace URLs in each source code with those that match your server and domain name. Look for 5-consecutive asterisks (i.e., *****) in each source code where you need to change URLs.    

Updates

2022-4-2: I revised several JavaScript files for preventing potential bugs
